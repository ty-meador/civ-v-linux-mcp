# Declared limitations

What the harness will not do, and why, as of runtime v207 (2026-09-25). Each item was checked against the
engine, not inferred; the check is named. `docs/GAPS.md` keeps the full audit history.

## Engine rules that look like missing features

- **Melee fire support never fires.** Stock Brave New World ships `FIRE_SUPPORT_DISABLED = 1` in
  `GlobalDefines` (base and expansion2), so `Unit:GetFireSupportUnit` returns nothing even with a ranged unit
  adjacent to the defender, in range, with line of sight and attacks left (S1 t266). The preview's
  `fire_support_damage` is a faithful 0; it would light up under a mod that flips the define.
- **Lump-sum gold needs a Declaration of Friendship.** A Brave New World rule for humans and AIs alike;
  gold per turn is not gated. The stock pocket just hides the Gold row; `trade_catalog.gold.note` says why
  (checked S1 t266: of four met civs only the friend traded lump gold either way).
- **Ranged units need line of sight** unless they have Indirect Fire (`CanRangeStrikeAt` false through a
  hill), exactly as the stock game plays it.
- **The golden-age combat row** exists only for a civ whose trait sets `GetTraitGoldenAgeCombatModifier`
  (Persia). Other seats can never show it. Seen live S6 t214 (Persia, "Golden Age Bonus +10").
- **Forced peace lasts through the treaty's final turn.** `declare_war` is refused with "forced peace in
  effect" on the treaty's `final_turn` itself (S2b t236); war is possible from the next turn.
- **The end-turn blocker is frozen while a popup is up.** `GetEndTurnBlockingType` is not re-evaluated
  while `UI.IsPopupUp()`, so the last ready unit's order plus an announcement popup raised on the way (a
  city-state met by that unit, a natural wonder, a text box) leaves `ENDTURN_BLOCKING_UNITS` on the books
  with `HasReadyUnit()` false (S6 line t215-t216, GitLab #23). `turn_status` reports it as `blocking_stale`
  with `todo` computed live; `end_turn` sweeps the popup and the engine re-evaluates at once.

## Engine calls the harness refuses to make

- **Path overlay and movement cost.** `Unit:GeneratePath` throws (not implemented), `GetPathEndTurnPlot`
  needs the mouse pathfinder, and `Plot:MovementCost` crashed the process (t183) even inside `pcall`. The
  harness never invents turns-to-reach; `explore_frontier` reports hex distance over the revealed map,
  `tactical_view` reports per neighbour only what `move_unit` would refuse before sending (`open` is not a
  cost), and
  the tile carries its yields, fresh water, routes and resource hover instead. Trade-route lines are a
  different thing and are readable: `trade_routes().path` is the plot hover's route list on every
  revealed plot (runtime v212), with the caravan, its escort and enemies beside the line.
- **Headless deal building.** Every `Add*` on `UI.GetScratchDeal()` outside a real trade session crashed
  the game (eight crashes, 2026-09-16). All deals, peace terms, demands and vote pledges drive the real
  leader and trade screens and read the reply from them.
- **Choosing a puppet's production, buying its plots or managing its citizens.** The engine accepts these
  orders; the stock city screen never offers them. Venice's puppets expose only their purchase list
  (`purchase_only`), as the stock production popup does.
- **Running the gamecore from another seat.** Every read and write is refused unless that seat is active
  (`this seat is not active`), so nothing about another human's pending answer leaks before their turn.

## Information the harness withholds on purpose

The seat sees what a human in that seat sees, and no more: fogged tiles carry last-seen features and
improvements but no live occupants; unmet civs stay masked in demographics and league rows; a rival's tech
list is never listed behind an embassy (only techs ahead of us, as the stock screen shows); deal rows carry
coordinates only for revealed cities; no private AI state (approach, deal valuation) is ever read.

## Still to be seen live

The four states this section used to wait for have all been reached: the Switch Ideology button and the
switch with anarchy (GitLab #13, S4 t239), a capture of our civilian by the other human seat (#22, S2b
t237-238), Venice buying in a puppet (#15, S5 t215), and the greeting popup that leaves
`ENDTURN_BLOCKING_UNITS` with an empty todo (#23, S6 line t215-t216). What remains has regression coverage
only:

- **War on a city-state over LAN.** `declare_war` on a minor sends `DoFromUIDiploEvent` where the stock
  screen sends `Network.SendChangeWar` (`docs/COVERAGE_AUDIT_2026-09-19.md`, G-D3). It works on the
  active seat; whether the declaration syncs to the other machines of a LAN game has not been checked.
- **LAN mode since 0.5.0.** Every live row on the 0.5.0 and 1.0.0 tables is a solo or hotseat game.
  `join_lan`, `host_lan`, the second-instance client and the supervisor's rejoin rest on the earlier
  sessions in `docs/NOTES.md`; `tests/test_supervisor.py` covers the supervisor's decisions.
- **Game over.** After the last spaceship part the end-turn blocker keeps reading
  `ENDTURN_BLOCKING_PRODUCTION` (`docs/NOTES.md`, Science Victory t457); `turn_status.game_over` is the
  read to check first, since the blocker is stale once the game has ended.

# Resume here — 2026-09-17 (fifteenth session, solo China game)

## User directive for the next session

The user will set up a **fresh game for Claude to play alone** (single LLM seat, in-game AI opponents)
and sleep. Play it to win, manually, turn by turn, and fix/catalog harness bugs as they come up.
Standing rules: [[feedback-civ5-play-manually]] (no heuristic play loops), quick_save every turn,
human-visible information only, don't flip 2D/3D, commit incrementally, don't push.

Victory conditions the user prefers: domination, science or culture. Diplomatic victory OFF (too easy on
a small map). Difficulty "hard" = HANDICAP_EMPEROR on the human slot(s).

## How to control the game (no MCP client attached in the last session)

```sh
.venv/bin/python scripts/mcp_call.py --seat 0 turn_status '{}'      # goes through the real MCP tool layer
.venv/bin/python scripts/mcp_call.py --seat 0 wait_for_my_turn '{"timeout": 360}'
```

Seat: `--seat 0` for a game hosted from this desktop (LAN host or single human). The desktop instance is
launched by `scripts/launch_civ5.sh` (shim + 8-CPU taskset), bridge by `python -m harness.tunerd`
(socket `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/civ5-tuner.sock`). If the user hosts through the game UI, `cli.py status`
shows `StagingRoom`; ready up with the Lua in the "Ready up" snippet below, then `launch_game()`.

Ready up + launch from a user-made lobby:
```python
from harness.game import Game; g=Game(); c=g.c; stg=c.wait_state("StagingRoom",5)
c.exec(stg,"local me=Matchmaking.GetLocalID(); PreGame.SetNickName(me,'Claude'); PreGame.SetReady(me,true); Network.BroadcastPlayerInfo()")
g.launch_game(); g.wait_ingame(); g.detect_seat(); g.quick_save()
```
`cli.py host-lan` now takes `--map continents.lua --size WORLDSIZE_SMALL --close 3 --handicap HANDICAP_EMPEROR`.

## What happened this session (2026-09-17, ~00:00-01:00)

- Steam Deck (`deck@10.10.10.171`) set up as a second LLM seat for Grok: switched Civ V from Proton to
  the native Linux build, harness + venv installed, user systemd units `steam-harness`, `civ5-game`,
  `civ5-tunerd`. Full how-to: `docs/DECK_HOWTO.md`; LLM-player playbook: `docs/GROK_PLAYBOOK.md`.
- Two 3-seat LAN games were started (Claude host on desktop, Grok/Siam on the Deck, 1 AI). The user is
  parking the Deck idea for now: the Deck crashed once (new signature, gamecore DLL null-deref, see
  NOTES.md) and driving both seats by hand was clumsy. The current LAN game (turn 2, Claude = Indonesia,
  Jakarta at (38,29), Pottery researching, Scout in production) is effectively abandoned.
- Harness fixes committed this session:
  - `dismiss_pending_popups` now closes `TextPopup` (BUTTONPOPUP_TEXT message boxes, e.g. "player
    disconnected") and cancels `DeclareWarPopup` confirmations (BUTTONPOPUP_DECLAREWARMOVE "entering that
    territory would trigger war") via `HideWindow()`, then clears the stale H.popups record because
    HideWindow does not fire PopupProcessed. **Neither has been re-verified live after the final edit**
    -- the Deck seat's stuck DECLAREWARMOVE was cleared by hand with the same calls, which is the evidence.
  - `host_lan` gained map_script / world_size / closed_seats / handicap.
  - `launch_civ5.sh` gained CIV5_STEAM_LIB / CIV5_SLR_LIB overrides; `scripts/launch_deck.sh` preset.

## Known gotchas fresh in mind

- `move_unit` into an unrevealed plot is refused ("plot is not revealed") -- use `map_window` first.
- `move_unit` toward a city-state/rival border silently pops the war-move confirmation; the unit does not
  move and `MISSION_SKIP` does not clear ENDTURN_BLOCKING_UNITS until that popup is dismissed.
- The game rewrites config.ini on exit; a relaunch by the user through Steam's UI (no shim) leaves the
  tuner disabled in MP. Always relaunch through the harness launcher.
- The mcp guard blocks every action tool with "popup needs a decision" while any recorded popup remains;
  `wait_for_my_turn` runs the sweep.

## Current game state (2026-09-17, fifteenth session, ~18:30)

Solo China game (Wu Zetian, Emperor), **turn 289 ending** (check `logs/et_last.log` / `python3
scripts/turn_brief.py` first). Runtime v77. Same driving recipe as before (`mcp_call.py --seat 0`,
`scripts/et.sh > logs/et_last.log` in the background, `--wait-only` after answering an AI).

- **Five cities**: Xian founded t284 at (43,12) (MISSION_FOUND had been refused by a harness bug, see
  NOTES). Beijing Porcelain Tower (14t), Shanghai Opera House (11t), Guangzhou Public School (6t),
  Nanjing Stock Exchange (6t), Xian Monument (5t). Worker 49155 farming (43,11) for Xian; Musketman
  737280 fortified at (43,11) (bought t284 to clear the barbarian camp next to Xian).
- Happiness 16 (Zanzibar ally since t285, Gems from Sweden), science 275, gold ~410 at +49/turn,
  culture 1131/1425, faith 231 (nothing bought with faith yet). Research Archaeology (1t) -> Biology
  chain toward Plastics. Research Agreement with Poland since t286 (friends since t281).
- Caravel 540678 exploring the east coast north from (57,30); `explore_frontier` now flags
  `closed_border` (Sidon at (53,32) blocked the path).
- Deals: Gems -> America 5 GPT (to ~t303); Copper -> Venice; Copper -> Sweden (~t292); Gems from
  Sweden for 9 GPT + OB (t283, ~t313).
- Returned two captured civilians (America's Settler t285, Genoa's Worker t286 -> Genoa Friends).
  Barbarian Musketman at Nanjing killed t289 by city strikes + Chu-Ko-Nu double shots.

## Immediate next work

1. Read `logs/et_last.log`; act on `todo`. Archaeology done t290 -> pick Biology (or Rifling if
   military pressure). Consider spending faith (231) once a Great Person / Missionary is worth it.
2. Xian: Monument -> Granary -> Lighthouse; work the Wheat/Fish. Buy a Worker if 49155 is too slow.
3. Cargo Ship still untested: `available_production` lists none in Shanghai (trade-route slots full,
   5/5). When a caravan route expires, build one and test a sea route to a major civ.
4. Untested still: CHOOSE_IDEOLOGY (3 factories or Modern era), ADD_REFORMATION_BELIEF,
   CHOOSE_ARCHAEOLOGY (Archaeology done next turn: Archaeologists + dig sites are new ground).
5. `generic_popup` / `answer_popup` (t285-286) handled RETURN_CIVILIAN live; ANNEX/PUPPET/RANSOM
   layouts go through the same shim but are unverified.

## Thirteenth session (2026-09-17, ~14:00-14:30)

- New `explore_frontier(unit_id, limit)` tool/route (runtime v64-v66): fog-edge plots of the unit's
  domain, nearest first, `unrevealed_neighbors`, terrain, `map_edge` on polar rows. Caveat: `distance`
  is hex distance, not path length (see NOTES thirteenth session).
- `mcp_call.py` tool errors exit 1 cleanly (no ExceptionGroup traceback).
- Tests 34/34: `uv run --with pytest pytest -q tests`.

## Tenth session (2026-09-17, ~09:30-): propose_deal works (real trade screen)

`propose_deal(player_id, items, ask_counter)` and `negotiate_deal(player_id, items, mode)` are live MCP tools
now (see NOTES.md tenth session). They drive LeaderHeadRoot.OnTrade -> DiploTrade pocket handlers ->
OnPropose and close everything themselves; results carry measured `effects`. Venice holds one of my Copper
for free until t261 (dev accident, see NOTES). Game still at **turn 231** when this was written.

## Immediate next work

1. Read `logs/et_last.log` (turn_brief.py): act on `todo`, `blocking_hint`, any discussion.
2. Nanjing Settler -> eastern strip (see route above). This is the first live embark + cross-sea settle;
   expect move_unit / MISSION_FOUND edge cases and fix them.
3. Navigation -> Seaport in Shanghai; then a Cargo Ship once a trade-route slot frees (t282 earliest,
   `trade_routes` shows turns_left) to test sea trade routes.
4. Untested still: CHOOSE_IDEOLOGY (3 factories or Modern era), ADD_REFORMATION_BELIEF, CHOOSE_ARCHAEOLOGY.
5. Harness idea: `explore_frontier` cannot report path length (Unit:GeneratePath NYI); consider marking
   plots on the far side of land as `same_water_body=false` via a flood fill over revealed water.

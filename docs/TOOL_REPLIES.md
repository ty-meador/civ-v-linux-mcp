# Tool replies, key by key

Served by `how_to_play(<tool>)`. Each section is the full description of one tool's answer: the tool's own
description keeps what a turn needs (a client shows only its first couple of thousand characters) and points
here for the rest. The text below is the description as it stood before it was shortened (2026-09-27), kept
whole; extend it here when a reply gains a key.

## finish_turn

The turn boundary as one call: end my turn, wait until it is my turn again, and return the new turn --
`status` (as turn_status: todo, blocking_name + blocking_hint, popups), `digest` (as turn_digest: what
happened while I was away), `turn`, and `notes` (what I told remember() since my last finish_turn or
briefing; `notes_unshown` {count, more} counts the older ones, recall() has them all; notes="all" brings
the latest eight back). Progress notifications go out every few seconds while waiting. If the turn will
not end, ok=false and `end_turn` carries the refusal with the todo that blocks it: nothing is waited on.

Safe to repeat: when it is already not my turn (a client timeout cut the previous call, or an AI's question
was just answered) it only waits, it never ends a second turn. Returns early with discussion_pending=true
(an AI wants an answer: discussion() then respond_discussion / accept_deal / refuse_deal / dismiss_discussion,
then call this again) or tech_popup_pending=true (set_research), like wait_for_my_turn.

skip_quiet_turns=N: keep ending turns, up to N more, while nothing needs me -- no unit awaiting orders, no
empty city, no promotion, no popup, no blocker, no expiring city-state ally, and nothing eventful in the
digest (combat, losses, cities changing hands, wars, leaders talking, wonders, great people, religion,
espionage, congress, trade routes...). wake_on adds my own words to that list, matched case-insensitively
against event kinds and notification text (e.g. ["Machinery", "Pocatello"]). The digests of the skipped
turns are merged into the result and `turns_skipped` / `woke_because` say what happened. The harness never
issues an order on my behalf: cities keep building their queues and research continues, that is all.
`status.alerts` wakes the run only when it worsens against the previous turn this process saw (happiness_drop,
unhappy:<tier>, strategic_deficit:<resource>, unit_supply:<deficit>): the same happiness 1 across a five-turn Circus does not, but the
alert is on every returned status regardless. `todo.ongoing` (automated units, standing moves) never wakes
the run by itself; a row's `attention` does (ongoing:<unit_id>:camp / hostile / destination_unrevealed ...):
an explorer simply exploring lets the run continue, one beside a visible camp or brute stops it.
`expiring_deals` / `expiring_friendships` wake it like an expiring city-state ally does.
`status.orders` (when I have conditional orders, see give_order) says what each did at this turn start: rows
with `did`, `status`, `state`, `pause`; an order that paused, failed or completed wakes the run
(order:<id>:<status>), one simply walking or building does not. With briefing=true the top-level `orders`
keeps only each order's id, unit, status and `did`; its state (now, pause, steps) is in briefing.orders.

timed_out=true means the AIs are still moving after timeout_seconds: call again. Verified in Claude Code
(2026-09-25): a 420 s wait with progress every 5 s came back with the server's own timeout, not a client
cutoff (the client moves a call past 120 s to a background task and reports its result), so 600-1800 is
fine there; with a client that has a hard per-call limit, stay under it.

One client owns the turn: the turn's first order claims it for that process, and another client of the
same seat calling this gets ok=false with `turn_claim` (holder pid, how long it has held the turn, when
the claim expires) instead of ending a turn out from under it. The claim lapses 180 s after the holder's
latest order or when its process exits; force=true takes it over at once. A quiet-turn run claims each
turn it ends; if a second client acts on one first, the run stops and returns that turn
(woke_because other_client_holds_turn).

briefing=true hands the new turn back as `briefing` (see the briefing tool: decisions, changes, board,
threats, notes) in place of `status` and `digest`: the briefing counts and lists the same events from the
game's log, and briefing(since="turn", limit=50) repeats every one of them. When the turn comes back behind
a gate (a discussion, a timeout, another seat) only the gate is briefed and `status` / `digest` stay as
usual.

## briefing

My turn in one compact read, for deciding (and for recovering after a context reset): what I must do,
what changed, and what the board looks like. Keys:
`seat`, `turn`, `gate` (as turn_status; while one is up only the gate comes back, `withheld` says so).
`baseline`: what the changes compare against -- {comparable, turn, turns_ago, events_since} after an
earlier briefing of this game and seat; comparable=false with `reason` on the first briefing, or when the
last one was on a later turn (a save was loaded). The baseline is kept beside my notebook, so a new
session still compares against the last briefing, and every briefing replaces it.
`decisions`: every mandatory item, never cut -- units needing orders (id, type, x, y, moves), promotions,
cities with nothing to build, research unset, an incoming deal, a spy's stolen tech, decision popups, and the
blocker when it is none of those -- each with the tool that clears it. `decisions_total` counts them.
`warnings`: facts that do not block the turn (status alerts, expiring deals / friendships / city-state
allies). `opportunities`: optional -- idle caravans and spies, free trade-route slots.
`changes`: since the baseline -- `empire` totals {was, now}, `cities` (new, gone, pop, production: the item
a city was building left its queue), `units` (new, gone), and `events` {total, by_kind, items} from the
game's event log. The briefing reads that log with its own cursor, so it never takes events away from
turn_digest or finish_turn's digest, and they never take them from it.
`empire`: the overview totals. `cities`: {total, rows} -- only cities worth a look (no production,
completes or grows next turn, starving, damaged, razing) with `why`. `units`: {total, by_type, ongoing,
attention (ongoing units beside a camp or hostile), damaged}. `threats`: visible hostile combat units within
4 plots of a city or 2 of a unit, nearest first: id, unit, hp, x, y (owner when not barbarian), `near`
{unit, unit_d, city, city_d} and an `assessment` that is distance only (no combat odds); one my previous
briefing listed is marked `seen` and, unless it moved (`moved_from`), carries only its position, hp and
`d` (plots to my nearest unit or city); detail="full" gives every field of every row. Plus revealed
barbarian `camps` within 4 plots of a city. `civ_rules`: my leader's trait text (Venice cannot found
cities; ...), included when there is no comparable baseline or since="turn".
`notes`: my notebook entries written since my last briefing or finish_turn (notes="new"), with
`notes_unshown` {count, more} for the rest -- recall() has every note; notes="all" is the latest `limit`
of them; the default "auto" is "all" with since="turn" and "new" otherwise. `assignments` (only when I have active ones; see assign):
{active, by_state, rows} -- condition_met and needs_review first, each with purpose, state, reasons or
evidence, its units / cities as they are now and the target as observed; a unit_orders decision whose unit
is assigned carries `assignment` {id, role}. One more game read when there are any.
`orders` (only when I have open conditional orders; see give_order): {open, paused, rows} -- paused first, each
with its unit, `now` (the current step), `state` and `pause` (kind, reason, hint); a unit_orders decision whose
unit has one carries `order` {id, status, reason}. Read from the notebook: no game read.
Size: every list except `decisions` stops at `limit` (default 8, max 50) with `omitted` and `more` naming the
tool that shows the rest. since="turn" lists every event after my previous turn ended (use it after a
context reset, or with a larger limit to see events a short briefing left out); the default lists those
since my previous briefing. Five game reads; nothing another seat can see is read.

## turn_status

Whose turn it is, current turn number, whether it is my turn, what blocks ending it,
and whether a greeting/discussion/tech/great-person screen is up (those are not in pending_popups).
todo.steal_tech is a pending spy-steal chooser even when blocking_name is something else
(the engine reports one blocker at a time; a human still sees the Steal Technology notice).
While a leader screen is up (leader_greeting_pending / discussion_pending) the game freezes blocking_name
and todo: read it with discussion(), close a plain greeting with dismiss_discussion(), then look again.
From the main menu (no game loaded) reports {"ingame": false, "screen": ...} instead: use load_latest
/ load_save to get back into a game. `seat` is the player this server plays.
`alerts` is a short list of facts about my own empire that do not block the turn and are not in todo, copied
from the same reads as overview: {kind: "happiness", happiness, unhappy} when the total is 2 or below or an
unhappy tier (unhappy / very_unhappy / super_unhappy) is set, and {kind: "strategic_deficit", resource,
available, deficit, total, used} for each revealed strategic resource with a negative available count, and
{kind: "unit_supply", deficit, cap, used, production_penalty} while the empire is over its unit supply cap
(the top bar's own string: the engine's deficit counts military units, so 15 units of 14 supplied with no
penalty is not a row). `happiness` (the bare total) rides on every status. Empty means neither applies; a happy empire with spare
iron has []. No advice is attached: which building or trade would change the number is a different read.
`todo.ongoing` lists my units the game is already moving -- automated (AUTOMATE_EXPLORE / AUTOMATE_BUILD) or
walking a move_unit order that needs more turns -- with id, type, x, y, moves, hp, `automated`, `mission_name`
and `going_to: {x, y}` when a destination is stored. They never block end_turn and are not decisions; a new
move_unit / unit_mission takes an automated unit back. `attention` on a row names what a human would look at:
a visible barbarian camp on or beside the unit, a visible hostile combat unit beside it, a destination no
longer revealed or passable. Absent when nothing is ongoing.
`expiring_deals` lists my deals with a major civ ending within 3 turns: {player_id, civ (only once met),
turns_left, ends_on, items: ["we give GOLD_PER_TURN 1", "they give ALLOW_EMBASSY", ...]} -- the rows
current_deals prints. It is left off while the trade table holds an offer or a draft (the snapshot never
clears one) and while another seat's proposal waits. `expiring_friendships` lists declarations of
friendship ending within 5 turns: {player_id, civ, turns_left, ask_too_soon when the leader screen greys
out the renewal}; propose_friendship renews one. Both are read on my own turn only and absent when empty.
`gate` is the one thing to read first: null means act freely; otherwise it names what must happen before
any action works (not your turn, your hand-off screen, a paused engine, a leader screen, a decision popup...)
and `clear_with` is the tool that does it. Every refusal carries the same object.

## overview

My empire at a glance: gold, science, culture, happiness, research, era, counts, turn/year, and
`strategic_resources` (revealed ones only) with `available` spare copies -- negative means a deficit:
units/buildings consume more than the empire owns and they fight/produce at a penalty.
`luxuries` is every revealed luxury with owned/imported/exported copies (`last_copy` if selling it
would drop the happiness bonus). `bonus_resources` is the resource list's bonus stack (Wheat,
Cattle, and the rest): a row only when the empire's total is above zero or some is exported.
A revealed strategic also carries `used` when the resource list would print that column.
`happiness_breakdown` / `gold_breakdown` / `science_breakdown` /
`culture_breakdown` / `tourism_breakdown` / `faith_breakdown` are the top-bar tooltips.
`happiness_breakdown` also carries the Happiness screen's expandable rows: `happiness.by_luxury`
(each luxury's happiness, not its copy count), `extra_per_luxury`, `league`, `difficulty`
(the residual the screen labels "from Difficulty Level"), `cities` (building happiness, local
happiness, connection happiness, unhappiness, and whether the city is occupied), and
`unhappiness.tooltips` (the Number of Cities / Citizens hovers). `unhappy` is unhappy /
very_unhappy / super_unhappy, and `penalties` are the red sentences on the tooltip.
`gold_breakdown.expenses.unit_paid` / `unit_free` / `unit_cost_per` is the Economic Overview
unit-maintenance tooltip (gold per paid unit). `unit_supply` is the Military Overview header
(cap from handicap/cities/population, remaining or deficit + production_penalty when over).
`score_breakdown` is the diplo-list / Victory Progress score tooltip (cities, pop, land, wonders,
techs, policies, great works, religion). `golden_age_progress` / `golden_age_threshold` are the
meter toward the next golden age.
trade_routes_used counts caravans/cargo ships alive, not running routes: `idle_trade_units` lists the ones sitting
without a route (give them one with available_trade_routes + establish_trade_route). `trade_units_queued` is the
ones in any city's queue; the engine trains none once used + queued reaches trade_routes_available, so
`free_trade_route_slots` = available - used - queued and `trade_note` says what to route and what to build.
`idle_spies` lists unassigned spies the same way (available_spy_cities + move_spy).
An idle trade unit carries `in_city` (its city, or false in the field) plus the nearest city to walk
it to: only one standing in a city of mine can be given a route at all.

## compare

Your candidates side by side in one read, for a decision you are weighing; the facts, never a pick.
kind="production": city_id + candidates (up to 8 UNIT_/BUILDING_/PROJECT_/PROCESS_ types, e.g. from
available_production): can_produce (or `why` not: missing tech or building, resource, civ restriction, puppet;
why_unknown=true when no rule was found), cost, stored, turns, gold/faith price with *_can_buy and *_short
(treasury gap), effects (strength or flat / per-pop / percent yields, happiness, slots), conditional (per-tile
yields with how many of this city's tiles qualify, worked or not), estimated_change (city yields; the formula
is in assumptions), maintenance (unit upkeep is empire-wide, so a unit's is "unknown"), unique_replaces; a
Venice puppet is purchase_only.
kind="research": candidates = up to 8 TECH_ types: status (researched / current / available / locked /
never), cost, progress, turns (available ones), missing_prereqs, path_beakers and path_turns_estimate for a
locked one, unlocks.
kind="improvements": unit_id (a worker) + optional plots ([[x, y], ...], default: plots within 2 you own or
with a resource) + optional candidates (BUILD_ types; default: every legal build but roads and forts): per plot
yields_now, worked, city; per build legal (or why), turns (work only; the walk is not included), tile_change,
empire_change only when a city works the tile, removes / chop_production, connects (a resource), maintenance.
Fogged plots are not read. sort= a yield (largest tile gain first) or "turns".
kind="trade": unit_id (a caravan or cargo ship in a city): every destination with what each end receives,
distance, and hazard (visible hostiles and camps near the destination, not_visible plot count, danger =
visible_threat / none_visible -- never "safe": the path is unknown before the route is set). sort= gold,
science, food, production, *_them or distance.
Every answer has context (seat, turn, city/unit), sources (where each field comes from), assumptions (behind
every estimate), n / returned, and `omitted` with the arguments that fetch the rest (`limit`, 1-20).
detail="full" adds help text (production) and the chooser's hover breakdown (trade).

## propose_deal

Offer a trade to another civ. With an AI: drives the game's real leader/trade screens (the only
crash-free path; headless deal building crashes the engine), proposes, reads the reply, closes the
screens and reports measured `effects` (gold, gold/turn, happiness, deal count, per-resource
import/export before vs after) -- so there is nothing to poll afterwards. With another human seat:
builds the same table on the PvP deal screen and sends it (`pvp: true`, `pending: true`); that seat
sees it as turn_status.pending_deal_from / incoming_deal on its turn and answers with accept_deal or
refuse_deal, after which both seats' current_deals agree. Lump-sum gold is legal only under a
Declaration of Friendship with that civ (a Brave New World rule, human or AI alike; trade_catalog's
`gold.note` says so); gold per turn is not gated (given income).
items: [{"type":"RESOURCES","resource":"RESOURCE_DYE","from_us":true,"amount":1},
        {"type":"RESOURCES","resource":"RESOURCE_SPICES","from_us":false,"amount":1}]
Types: GOLD / GOLD_PER_TURN (amount), RESOURCES (resource, amount), OPEN_BORDERS, ALLOW_EMBASSY,
DEFENSIVE_PACT, RESEARCH_AGREEMENT, TRADE_AGREEMENT (from_us picks the direction), CITIES (city_id),
VOTE_COMMITMENT (resolution_id, choice_id, repeal: a World Congress vote pledge; the side's whole core
vote goes on the table, as the screen's pocket does -- pick from trade_catalog().vote_commitments),
THIRD_PARTY_WAR / THIRD_PARTY_PEACE (other: player id; the side declares war on / makes peace with that
civ or city-state when the deal is accepted -- pick an `ok` row from trade_catalog().third_party).
PEACE_TREATY (no fields): at war every table carries the treaty on both sides (the screens seed it), so any
propose_deal while at war is a peace deal with terms; refused with the leader screen's reason while locked
into war -- see trade_catalog().peace, or call make_peace(player_id, items).
Use trade_catalog(player_id) first to see what is legal, how much gold / gold-per-turn each side can put
up, and which cities (`cities.us` / `cities.them`) the game allows trading -- capitals never are.
Refuses -- without opening any screen -- an amount that is not a positive whole number or exceeds what
that side has, and a city_id outside trade_catalog().cities; refuses -- without proposing -- if any item
does not land on the table at the requested amount (e.g. they own none of that resource).
ask_counter=true: on rejection also returns the AI's own counter-offer (`counter.items`) which can be
passed straight back into propose_deal. Duration of timed items is the game's deal length (30 turns).

## give_order

Give one of my units a short sequence of steps that the harness carries out over the coming turns, so a
plan already chosen does not cost a call every turn. steps (at most 6, in order):
{kind: "move", x, y} -- walk there (move_unit; multi-turn); {kind: "build", build: "FARM"} -- build it on
the plot the previous move ends on (or where the unit stands; x, y to name another); {kind: "heal", hp: 80}
-- heal until hp is at least that percent (default 100); {kind: "hold", mission: "fortify"|"sleep"|"alert"}
-- the last step. Example: move to (12,8), then build FARM; or heal to 80, move to (30,14), hold.
The order runs now (start=true) as far as it can, then again at the start of each of my turns (the result
of finish_turn / wait_for_my_turn carries `orders`): each step is issued through move_unit / unit_mission,
at most once per turn, after the checks below.
It pauses and hands the unit back -- with `pause.reason` and `hint` -- instead of taking another step when:
a hostile comes into sight within interrupt.hostile_within plots (default 2; 0 = off; those in sight now
are acknowledged), the unit was damaged (interrupt.damaged, default true), hp is below interrupt.hp_below
percent (off by default, never during a heal), an enemy stands on the destination (an order never attacks),
move_unit would refuse the destination, a step is refused, the unit is not where a build needs it, the unit
makes no progress for a turn, a save was loaded, or I give that unit a direct order (move_unit /
unit_mission take it back). A lost or replaced unit fails the order. An order never declares war, attacks,
ends the turn or touches any other unit. A unit on automation (AUTOMATE_BUILD / AUTOMATE_EXPLORE) leaves it the moment its order is stored, even when no step could run yet (`automation_stopped`), so the game never walks it away first. One open order per unit: replace_id replaces one (a new unit id
after an upgrade too). A first step that cannot run now refuses the order and stores nothing. Stored in my
notebook, so orders survive a restart; briefing() lists them.

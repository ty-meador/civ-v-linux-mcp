"""The nine tools of milestone 2.0.0 (GitLab #48, stage 2a): the game as a clock, a world of objects, the
questions it asks, my notebook and the session.

One of the civ5 MCP server's tool modules (registered last by harness/mcp_server.py). Each tool routes its
call through `harness.surface.dispatch` onto the old handler and runs it with the server's own runner (by the
handler's exact name, so no `renamed` rides on it), so the old guard, ledger row and reply are exactly what
they were: `state(what="screen", view="league")` returns
`league_status()` byte for byte. `reference(book, section)` is the old `reference` tool grown a `book`
(harness/mcp_tools/reference.py). The 145 old handlers are registered and retired at once (`@retired`, #52): the
listing is these nine, and an old name answers through the retirement map with `renamed` on its reply.

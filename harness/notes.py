"""Per-game memory for the seat: the notes a human player keeps in their head between turns.

An LLM's context is compacted or lost between sessions; a human remembers "I am going Tradition then
Rationalism, Askia will backstab me, keep two archers in Moson Kahni". `Notebook` stores those notes
beside the game (not inside the save: the save format is not ours) keyed by a `game_key` the caller
derives from stable in-game facts, so every save of the same game shares one notebook and a different
game never sees it. Notes carry the turn they were written on; the caller decides which to surface.

Storage: `$CIV5_NOTES_DIR` or `$XDG_DATA_HOME/civ5-harness/notes` (default `~/.local/share/...`),
one JSON file per game key. No game connection is needed to read or write a notebook. The same file keeps the
seat's last turn-briefing snapshot under `briefing` (harness/briefing.py), what the next briefing compares against,
and the structured `assignments` (harness/assignments.py): role, purpose, fingerprinted units and cities, target,
completion condition, review triggers and status, beside the prose notes and independent of them. The conditional
unit `orders` (harness/orders.py: a unit's steps, the current one, its pause reason and last result) live there too.

A key can change form between releases (runtime v285 fixed the map part of the key: `Assets_Maps_pangaea` became
`pangaea`, and every notebook written before 2026-10-25 sat under the old form). `Notebook.adopt(legacy_key)`
renames such a file to the current key once, when the current key has no file yet; the caller that builds the
key (harness/game_parts/notebook.py) knows the old form and passes it.

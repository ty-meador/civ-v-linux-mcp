The class is assembled from one mixin per domain under harness/game_parts/ (front_end, turn, popups, events,
reads, cities, units, unit_orders, notebook, diplomacy, espionage, deals, policies, trade_routes); this file
keeps the transport (tunerd, the Lua runtime, q) and the helpers every part shares. `self` is always the whole
Game, so a part may call any other part's methods.

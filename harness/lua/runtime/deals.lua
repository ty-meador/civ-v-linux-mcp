--   * every Add* must be gated by the same deal:IsPossibleToTradeItem(from, to, TRADE_ITEM_*, ...) call
--     tradelogic.lua makes before showing a pocket button; H.trade_catalog below makes exactly those calls;

--     (tradelogic.lua only handles it when g_bPVPTrade; an AI's friendship is a diplo_event, not a deal item);
--   * deal:AddPeaceTreaty crashes natively even as the real UI's paired (us, them) call; peace is made
--     through the trade screen, which seeds the treaty on both sides itself (Game.make_peace), never a built deal.

"""The tactical view's legend, said once (GitLab #152).

The legend of `state(what="unit", view="tactical")` is prose that never changes between reads, and a seat read it
on every move check (about two thousand characters a time, four times in a Grok seat's opening turns). It lives in
docs/TOOL_REPLIES.md as the view's reply reference, where `reference(book="playbook", section=...)` serves it. A
server process attaches the whole text to its first tactical reply (`legend`) and a one-line `key` to every reply
after that, with the section's name so a reader who lost the first reply can ask for it again.
